"""livekit: things that are energized or pressurized, for a yam_arena task file (works with yamkit, and reads
cablekit, mechkit and twistkit parts when a task uses them).

A task declares a small network: electrical nodes joined by sources, wires, loads and conductive tools, and/or
pressure compartments joined by pipes, couplings and valves. The physical parts the robot moves decide which
connections are made (a cablekit clamp on a post, a mechkit breaker toggle past its throw, a twistkit coupling backed
off, a wrench whose bare metal touches two pads). Every control step (20 Hz, inside the hooked object_states, after
yamkit/cablekit/twistkit have updated) the kit solves the network, then appends to an ordered event log: connections
made and broken, sparks, and hazards, which are latched for the trial (an arc when a tool bridges a live terminal to
ground, a spray or hose whip when a coupling is opened under pressure, a backfeed when a source drives a line that
must be dead, liquid sucked back into a flask, air drawn into a brake line, a reservoir run dry).

    import yamkit as kit
    import cablekit as ck          # if the task has clamps or hoses

Electrical model (DC nodal analysis, solved with NumPy each step). Every `Wire` that is closed and every tool contact
is a small resistance (default 2 milliohm); a `Source` is an ideal EMF with an internal resistance (a 12 V lead-acid
starting battery has about 5-10 milliohm, so a dead short draws 1,000+ A: the arc that welds a wrench to a terminal);
a `Load` is a resistance (given as ohms, or watts at a voltage) with an optional starting surge (a motor draws 3-6x its
running current for about a second). Nodes flagged `ground` are tied to 0 V (the vehicle chassis, the earth bar);
a tiny leak (1 microsiemens) to 0 V keeps floating parts solvable. A source that is off is an open circuit. Results:
node voltages, the current in every element, which nodes are joined by low-resistance paths (nets).
Events: "make"/"break" when a wire or tool contact closes or opens; "spark" when that happens with more than
`spark_amps` flowing (after a make, before a break; a hazard if the element has `spark_hazard`, e.g. a clamp near a
gassing battery); "short" (hazard) when a tool (or a wire given its own `fault_amps`) carries more than that (tools default to 100 A); "backfeed"
(hazard) when a node flagged `dead` (a utility line someone is working on) rises above `live_volts`, or a source
flagged `no_tie` finds another source's terminal on its own net, or a source with `reverse_amps` is driven backward;
"overload" (hazard) when a source with `max_amps` delivers more than that for `overload_s`; "live"/"dead" when a
node flagged `watch` changes.

Pressure model (lumped compartments, explicit integration with 20 substeps per control step and a per-pipe flow
limiter so a stiff, nearly liquid-full compartment cannot oscillate). A `Tank` is a closed compartment of `volume` mL
holding gas (tracked as mL at 1 atm and 20 C, i.e. an amount) and liquid (mL, incompressible); its absolute pressure
is the ideal-gas pressure of the gas in the space the liquid leaves, plus a fixed cushion worth 0.5% of the volume
(the compliance of hoses and seals: a liquid-full line sits at 1 atm and pressurizes steeply as more is pushed in,
by up to 0.5% of its volume, which takes about 1,000 atmospheres), at the tank's temperature (optionally heated by a burner: first-order toward `hot_c`
or back to `start_c`). "ambient" is the open air at 1 atm. A `Pool` is liquid open to the air with a `head` (a jar,
a water trough, a faucet's water). A `Supply` holds a set gauge pressure while `on` (a compressor, a water aspirator
pulling a vacuum, a brake pedal held down), optionally limited to `capacity` mL per press (the pedal reaches the
floor) and refilled from a reservoir tank; when it stops it can pull back (`return_psi`, the master cylinder's piston
returning) and then either closes or opens to the reservoir at 1 atm (`idle="pool"`, the compensating port). A `Pipe`
joins two of these with a linear conductance (mL/s per psi of difference at full open) times its open fraction
(0..1, from a valve angle, a coupling's backed-off angle, a hose fitting on or off). What a pipe carries out of a tank
depends on where its port is: "top" (gas first), "bottom" (liquid first) or "mixed" (in proportion to the gas and
liquid volumes, for bubbles spread through a line). Events: "open"/"close" for pipes; "release" (hazard) when a pipe
flagged with `release_psi` goes fully open with more than that pressure across it (a coupling or cap undone under
pressure sprays or whips); "burst" (hazard) above a tank's `rating`; a tank with `protect="liquid"` or `"gas"` logs
`protect_kind` (default "backflow", hazard) once more than `protect_ml` of that medium has flowed into it (water
sucked back into a filtrate, air drawn back into a brake caliper); `dry_ml` logs `dry_kind` (hazard) when its liquid
falls below that (a master-cylinder reservoir run dry lets air into the whole system).

Simplifications (state them in a task's fidelity): DC, steady state each 50 ms step (no inductance, no AC phase, so
paralleling two equal AC sources is flagged by topology with `no_tie`, not by current); contact is geometric
(bare-metal segment of a tool within its radius of a pad: no contact force or resistance that depends on pressure);
arcs do not weld or burn anything and nothing is drawn but the marker; gas is ideal and isothermal within a step,
liquid is incompressible, flow is linear in pressure difference (laminar-like), there is no inertia (no water
hammer), no gravity head inside tanks, and a tank's gas and liquid are well mixed except as its ports say. Numbers
for a task come from real equipment and should be cited there.

Scorer API (all follow the trial; `objects` is what score() gets and is unused by most, kept for uniformity):
- electrical: `volts(objects, node, ref=None)` (to ground, or to `ref`), `live(objects, node, ref=None, volts=None)`,
  `amps(objects, element)` (a wire's, a load's, a source's output; a tool's largest contact current),
  `closed(objects, element)`, `contacts(objects, tool)` (the nodes a tool touches now), `connected(objects, a, b)`
  (same low-resistance net now).
- pressure: `pressure(objects, name, unit="psi")` (gauge; "kPa", "inH2O", "bar" also; tanks, supplies, pools),
  `gas(objects, tank)` (mL at 1 atm), `liquid(objects, tank)`, `inflow(objects, tank, medium)` (mL that came in this
  trial), `delivered(objects, supply)`, `flow(objects, pipe)` (mL/s last step, + from a to b), `opening(objects, pipe)`,
  `temp(objects, tank)`.
- events: `events(objects, kind=None, where=None)` (ordered list of `Event(step, kind, where, value, hazard, point)`),
  `hazard(objects, kind=None, where=None)` (the first hazard event, latched: it stays after the cause is gone),
  `hazards(...)`, `first(objects, kind, where=None)` (its step or None), `order_ok(objects, sequence)` (the
  (kind, where) pairs happened in that order, each after the one before: a subsequence of the log), `step()`.
- `log(kind, where, value=None, hazard=False, point=None)` adds a task event; `watch(fn)` registers fn(objects),
  called every step after the solve (a task's own rules: a pilot flame lighting, a needle, a counter);
  `set_gas(tank, ml)` / `set_liquid(tank, ml)` for such rules.

Condition helpers (give them to `closed=`, `on=`, `open=`; each is fn(objects) -> bool or 0..1): `attached(key,
target=None)` (cablekit), `joint_past(key, at, sign=1)`, `joint_fraction(key, shut, full)` (a valve handle),
`backed_off(key, crack_deg, open_deg)` (a twistkit coupling: 0 seated, 1 off), `inside(body, point, region_body,
center, half)` (a hose end inside a jar), `near(body, point, other, other_point, r)`, `all_of`, `any_of`, `not_`,
`times` (product of fractions: a bleeder's opening while its hose is in the jar).
Gauges: `gauge(name, full, sweep, zero=0.0, unit="psi")` returns a `fn(J, mem)` for `mechkit.Follow(fn=...)`, so a
needle link reads a pressure (one control step behind, since mechanism drives are set before this kit's step).

Visuals (Isaac Lab VisualizationMarkers, optional, never scored): a bright flash at each spark, arc or release (for
`flash_s`), a dark scorch mark that stays at each latched short, a small lamp sphere per node with `lamp=True` (red
when live, dark when dead), white bubbles at a pipe flagged `show=True` while gas flows through it, and a water-colored
bead at a tank flagged `show=True` while liquid flows into it, and a flat white disc at a tank flagged `gas_show=True`
whose area follows the gas left in it (radius `AIR_R` at `gas_full`, default the tank's starting gas; hidden under 1%).
Sizes are set for the 320 x 176 top camera (a 1.6 cm flash, a 1.2 cm lamp, a 3.2 cm air disc when full).

Demo helpers: `press(xyz, depth, hold)` (a closed-finger push held down: a pedal, a button, a knob pushed in) and
`push_across(start, end)` (a closed-finger stroke: a toggle thrown, a wrench or valve handle swung) return
yam_arena Waypoints; end a demo with `kit.Home`.

Hook. Like cablekit and twistkit, the module chains yamkit's scene patch: the wrapped object_states runs the inner
states (yamkit's mechanisms and grippers, cablekit's attachments, twistkit's thread accounting) and then this kit's
`update`, once per control step. Import livekit after the other kits so it wraps them (imported earlier, it would see
their state one step late). Plain Python and NumPy at import; Isaac code only runs inside the simulator and is guarded.

Episodes: everything resets when yamkit's `episode()` changes (the simulator reset the scene); `reset()` by hand.
Tests: `setup(...)`, then call `update(objects)` once per step with hand-made ObjectStates (conditions are plain
callables, so tests drive them through a dict); bump `kit._EPISODE["count"]` for a new trial.
