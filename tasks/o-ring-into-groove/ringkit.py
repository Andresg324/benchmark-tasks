"""ringkit: elastic and split rings on a shaft (circlips, snap rings, O-rings), built on yamkit.

A ring sits on a shaft. Its inner radius is spring-loaded: left alone it closes toward its free (rest) radius, which is
smaller than the shaft, so it grips the shaft wherever it is, or springs into a groove when it is over one. A tool
spreads it (circlip pliers in its lug holes, a stretching cone for an O-ring); spread past the shaft it slides along
the shaft and turns about it with the tool. Spread past its elastic limit it takes a permanent set and is scrap.

    import yamkit as kit
    import ringkit as rk

    CLIP = rk.Ring("clip", end=(0, 0, 0.105), axis="-Z", shaft_d=0.040, free_id=0.0365, thickness=0.00175,
                   width=0.0045, length=0.05, grooves=(rk.Groove(at=0.0381, width=0.00185, diameter=0.0375),),
                   stop=0.039, limit_id=0.041, lug_gap=0.012, lug_out=0.0058, look=kit.Look((0.2, 0.2, 0.25)))
    fixture = kit.Mechanism("fixture", ..., links=(*rk.links(CLIP), ...))      # the shaft is part of the base
    pliers = rk.free_tool(kit.Mechanism("pliers", ..., mass=0.07, links=(jaw,)))  # a loose, articulated tool
    rk.attach("fixture", CLIP, rk.TipPair(("pliers", tip_a), ("pliers/jaw", tip_b)))

    rk.seated(objects, "fixture/clip")       # in the scorer

The model (all lengths in m; `s` is the ring's mid-plane position along the shaft, measured from the shaft's end face
into the shaft, so s = -thickness/2 is a ring lying on the end face):
- Shaft profile: radius shaft_d/2 for 0 < z <= length, a groove's bottom radius within each `Groove`, nothing past the
  end (z <= 0). The ring covers [s - t/2, s + t/2]; the radius it has to clear is the largest radius under it.
- Free: the ring closes to max(free radius + permanent set, the radius under it): gripping the land, closed into a
  groove, or (off the end) at its free radius. It does not move along the shaft or turn.
- Snap: a closed ring whose mid-plane is within half a groove width of the groove's middle sits in the groove (its own
  spring pushes it in); `stop` (optional) is a face the ring's far face cannot pass (the part it retains, a shoulder).
- Held by a tool (a spreader reports a `Grip`): the ring opens to what the tool asks (never smaller than the shaft
  under it allows), turns with the tool (unless cocked) and moves along the shaft toward where the tool puts it, but
  only as far as its radius clears the shaft by `clear` (diametral): a ring not spread far enough stays where it is,
  and the tool's tips slip out of it (the spreader then stops reporting a grip).
- Over-spread: the largest inner diameter ever reached is kept; past `limit_id` the excess becomes a permanent set
  (the free radius grows by it): such a ring may close loosely in its groove.
- Tilt and twist: the tool reports how far it tilts the ring's plane off square to the shaft and how far it twists
  the ring's two ends apart along the shaft. A ring that closes into a groove tilted more than `tilt_limit` degrees
  lands cocked (one side in the groove, the other on the land; not seated, it cannot turn); spreading it again frees
  it. The largest tilt and twist while held are kept for the scorer (FingerTips: tilt from the tips' heights).
- Seated: in a groove, closed onto the groove bottom (inner radius within `seat_tol` of it), not cocked, not held.

Spreaders (anything with `grip(ring, st, frame, objects) -> Grip | None`): `TipPair` is a pair of pliers tips in a
split ring's two lug holes. A tip engages when it is within `catch` of a lug hole across the shaft axis and its end
is inside the hole (below the ring's near face, at most `depth` past its far face). The ring's lug gap follows the
tips' spacing, so its inner radius grows by (tip spacing - rest lug gap) / (2 pi). Write another spreader for other
tools (an O-ring cone, fingers): it gets the ring spec, its state and the shaft frame, and returns a Grip or None.
`FingerTips` (this task's copy) is a gripper's two fingertips in an elastomer ring: the gripper opening stretches it
(its inner circumference is the convex loop round the fingertips' outer faces and, once both are outside the shaft,
the shaft), it rides down on the fingertips' ends and stays when they are drawn back out. A fingertip pressing on
the ring's face without stretching it pushes it (`Grip(push=True)`): a `Ring(roll=True)` then rolls along the shaft
instead of sliding, its section twisting by distance / (thickness / 2) rad; stretched clear of the shaft again it
springs back untwisted. A stretched ring is drawn along that loop.

Joints: `links(ring)` gives the ring's invisible, collider-less links for the fixture mechanism, all on its base:
"<name>_axial" (prismatic along the shaft: s), "<name>_turn" (revolute about it: the ring's turn, ccw seen from the
end) and "<name>" (prismatic: the opening, inner radius minus free radius). The kit writes them every control step
from its model, so `kit.joint(objects, "fixture/clip")` etc. read the ring too (one step behind the kit's readouts).
The ring is drawn with Isaac Lab visualization markers (segments of a band and two lug ears) at its current radius,
turn, tilt and twist; drawing never affects scoring. New marker prims take about five rendered frames to appear, so a
fourth link, "<name>_shown", carries a mesh of the ring at its start pose for the first SHOW_STEPS steps and is then
moved to s = `hide` (inside the table or fixture). Use a matte look: a metallic dark ring mirrors the bright dome.

Free tools: `free_tool(mech)` marks a loose (massed) Mechanism so that its base body carries the articulation root
(otherwise PhysX roots a floating articulation at its most central body and the joint drives misbehave).
`HandleSpring` is a law for a tool's handle (a preloaded return spring).

Scorer readouts (key "fixture/clip"; all reset with kit.episode()):
  position(objects, key)       s now (m)               groove(objects, key)      index of the groove it sits in, or None
  seated(objects, key)         seated now (see above)  engaged(objects, key)     a tool holds it now
  inner_d(objects, key)        inner diameter now (m)  max_d(objects, key)       largest inner diameter this trial
  overspread(objects, key)     max_d past limit_id     set_mm(objects, key)      permanent set (mm of radius)
  tilt_deg / max_tilt_deg      plane off square         max_twist_deg             largest twist while held
  cocked(objects, key)         landed tilted in a groove
  turned_deg(objects, key)     degrees turned while closed in a groove and not cocked (a seating check)
  twist_deg(objects, key)      an elastomer ring's roll left in it now (deg); max_roll_deg the largest this trial
Offline tests call `update(objects)` once per control step with hand-made ObjectStates (fixture, tool parts).
